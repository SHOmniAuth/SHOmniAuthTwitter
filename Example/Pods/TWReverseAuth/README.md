Credits goes to https://twitter.com/theSeanCook for doing the sample. 
I just cleaned it up, added a way to manage credentials with keychain and put it up on Cocoapods - since I needed it as a dependency for https://github.com/seivan/SHAccountManager


For now, check the TWApiManager header for usage. Will get back with a doc soon enough. Current date is Wed Mar 13 - if It takes me more than two days, give me a ping.
