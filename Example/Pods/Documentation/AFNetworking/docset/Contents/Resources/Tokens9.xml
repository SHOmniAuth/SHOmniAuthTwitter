@discussion By default, URL requests have a cache policy of NSURLCacheStorageAllowed and a timeout interval of 30 seconds, and are set not handle cookies. To configure URL requests differently, use setImageWithURLRequest:placeholderImage:success:failure:</Abstract>

					<Name>success</Name>
					<Abstract type="html">A block to be executed when the image request operation finishes successfully, with a status code in the 2xx range, and with an acceptable content type (e.g. image/png). This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the image created from the response data of request. If the image was returned from cache, the request and response parameters will be nil.</Abstract>
				</Parameter><Parameter>
					<Name>failure</Name>
					<Abstract type="html">A block object to be executed when the image request operation finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the error object describing the network or parsing error that occurred.

@discussion If a success block is specified, it is the responsibility of the block to set the image of the image view before returning. If no success block is specified, the default behavior of setting the image with self.image = image is executed.</Abstract>
